## Chit-chat using QnA Maker
If your chatbot is already using [QnA Maker cognitive service](https://qnamaker.ai) for powering a knowledge base of question-answers, you can easily add chit-chat to it when you create a Knowledge Base in the portal. You can see [instructions](https://aka.ms/qnamaker-chitchat-learnmore) for creating a knowledge base and adding chit-chat to it. 
To update or edit your existing knowledge base with a new chit-chat data set, you can choose a dataset that has been specifically curated to work with QnA Maker. Select the dataset that aligns with the personality you want for your bot. For example: *qna_chitchat_friendly.tsv*.
